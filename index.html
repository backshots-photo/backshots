	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redscale">Redscale</a> is an interesting technique to me as it&rsquo;s just the sort of thing that someone would do by accident somehow and then discover &ldquo;oh, this is good actually.&rdquo; Combined with the fact that it&rsquo;s simply using something incorrectly (exposing film through the base of the film stock so that light hits the red-sensitive layers first), it has just the level of ingenuity and slapshod hackery to make me love it.</p>&hellip;

	<p>Kodak films have never been particularly exciting to me: they’ve always felt a little staid and understated in their rendition of colour. With something like a ten year gap since I last really shot film, the colour film options available have somewhat reduced: outside of the more exotic cinema 35mm films and other ‘boutique’ films, there are only really a handful of options that are likely be available in more common high-street settings. With that in mind, I’d decided to cast aside my prejudice and give it a go.</p>&hellip;

	<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for anything I think I can fix. Whether this is people, the annoying drip from the pipe in a family member&rsquo;s kitchen or a camera that someone else has deemed irreparable. The latter reared its head when I was sixteen, with a Petri 7s that I bought from eBay for what was probably £15 (£24.40 in 2024 prices, adjusted for inflation). The leaf blades of the shutter were completely seized and covered in what could only be fairly described as &ldquo;gunk&rdquo; and I had a copy of the service manual. A copy of the service manual and absolutely no finesse with my hands was not sufficient to salvage the camera.</p>&hellip;
