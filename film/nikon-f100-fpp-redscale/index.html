<p>I shot this roll at the recommended ISO25, which apparently makes for a &lsquo;mild&rsquo; redscale effect: it&rsquo;s a slow film, but some loss of speed is to be expected from shooting through the far more opaque base of the film rather than directly onto emulsion. I think it&rsquo;s a pleasing result across the lighting conditions I shot it in, ranging from tail-end of British summer sun and some early autumn overcast. As in the above image, it&rsquo;s a free ticket to slightly more interesting colour tones than the boring greys of a lot of prefabricated buildings in London, with its colour shift giving a pesudo-monochrome look that highlights tones.</p>

<p>There is still colour to be had, though: as one would expect, reds and oranges sing, with greens and blues ending up a little more subdued than they may be on traditional negative films shot correctly. Hand-holding a camera, even at f/1.4, at ISO25 is a little tricky in the light that London often has to offer: I ended up with some far shakier photos than they should have been. I&rsquo;ll chalk this up as a learning experience and try to shake less in strong winds in future.</p>

<p>The film shone in mixed lighting from natural and artificial sources, such as in Waterloo station above on a bright day. The dynamic range of the film is surprising, given that (once again) we&rsquo;re using it incorrectly and exposing through the base, but the shadows never looked over-crushed and highlights weren&rsquo;t often blown out, other than through mistakes of my own making.</p>

<p>While I have moaned about how slow the film is above, I think it was actually a virtue: I think I probably lean on faster films a little too much to make up for my own impatience. Knowing that I was shooting a slower film and should probably pay more attention to how quickly I moved when taking a picture slowed me down and made me think more about what an appropriate composition might be. It probably won&rsquo;t be a film I pick up a lot of, but it has broken the disquiet I had had around making use of a some low-ISO black and white I picked up a while ago.</p>
