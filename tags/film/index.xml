      <description>Kodak films have never been particularly exciting to me: they&amp;rsquo;ve always felt a little staid and understated in their rendition of colour. With something like a ten year gap since I last really shot film, the colour film options available have somewhat reduced: outside of the more exotic cinema 35mm films and other &amp;lsquo;boutique&amp;rsquo; films, there are only really a handful of options that are likely be available in more common high-street settings.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for anything I think I can fix. Whether this is people, the annoying drip from the pipe in a family member&amp;rsquo;s kitchen or a camera that someone else has deemed irreparable. The latter reared its head when I was sixteen, with a Petri 7s that I bought from eBay for what was probably £15 (£24.40 in 2024 prices, adjusted for inflation). The leaf blades of the shutter were completely seized and covered in what could only be fairly described as &amp;ldquo;gunk&amp;rdquo; and I had a copy of the service manual.</description>
