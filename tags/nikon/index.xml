      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redscale&#34;&gt;Redscale&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting technique to me as it&amp;rsquo;s just the sort of thing that someone would do by accident somehow and then discover &amp;ldquo;oh, this is good actually.&amp;rdquo; Combined with the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s simply using something incorrectly (exposing film through the base of the film stock so that light hits the red-sensitive layers first), it has just the level of ingenuity and slapshod hackery to make me love it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nikon F100 with Kodak Ultramax 400</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kodak films have never been particularly exciting to me: they’ve always felt a little staid and understated in their rendition of colour. With something like a ten year gap since I last really shot film, the colour film options available have somewhat reduced: outside of the more exotic cinema 35mm films and other ‘boutique’ films, there are only really a handful of options that are likely be available in more common high-street settings. With that in mind, I’d decided to cast aside my prejudice and give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
