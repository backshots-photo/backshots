      <description>Kodak films have never been particularly exciting to me: they&amp;rsquo;ve always felt a little staid and understated in their rendition of colour. With something like a ten year gap since I last really shot film, the colour film options available have somewhat reduced: outside of the more exotic cinema 35mm films and other &amp;lsquo;boutique&amp;rsquo; films, there are only really a handful of options that are likely be available in more common high-street settings.</description>
